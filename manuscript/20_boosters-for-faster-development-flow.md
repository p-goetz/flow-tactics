# Boosters for Faster Development Flow

- How do you determine how well you are currently performing and whether improvements have been made actually help you?  <- The 7 questions?
	- The importance of a clear baseline to start improving
	- Value Stream Mapping and Flow Metrics
	- Establishing your Status Quo
- Identifying experiments to improve Flow
	- Where to search for improvement ideas <- The 7 questions?
	- How to set up small experiments <- How to use boosters / cards
- The concept of boosters: small tools that helped us in the past to improve a specific aspect of flow.  Readers can use these as a starting point for their own experiments. Boosters are actionable and usable individually or in the context of a team.

Boosters are:

- Templates, tools, and games for individuals and teams
- Create clarity (transparency), take the first step, or provide specific improvement ideas.
- Grouped by their effect on the development process plus general purpose boosters
- Currently planned: 15-30 boosters. We gathered around 40 concepts we use regularly in teams and will trim them down to the most approachable / important ones.
