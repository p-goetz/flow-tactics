## Understand Value

Does your organization truly understand how software delivery creates value and customer outcomes?

### What Is the Value of Our Product

Short explanation of the four perspectives on value:

Customer / user perspective
: what value do we believe our customers get from our product? *Example: solve a customer problem efficiently and cost-effectively*

Financial perspective
: what financial value does our product generate for our organization? *Example: the revenue a product generates or the price that can be charged for a product*

Internal business perspective
: what internal business value is created by the product for our organization? *Example: increase of employee knowledge or satisfaction or improvement of processes*

Innovation, market and intellectual perspective
: what value does the product create in terms of market share or segment, intellectual or technological value? *Example: new market segments or shares or innovative technologies that are being developed together with the product*

Brainstorm concrete examples of value we create with our product and assign them to a quadrant
