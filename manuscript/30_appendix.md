# Appendix

Optional deeper insights into concepts that are used in the book. These are used as small introductions for people not familiar with them. They reference further reading and keep the rest of book from being too bloated. Ideas include:

- Kanban and Little's Law: On origin story of flow and some useful key concepts.
- Team Topologies: An overview of the core concepts. We will use the interaction modes and concepts such as Thinnest Viable Platform, Fracture Planes etc. in individual boosters.
- DevOps Lifecycle
- â€¦
